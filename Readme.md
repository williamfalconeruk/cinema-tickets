# Ticket Calculation Service

This is in response to an exercise, based on [this requirement](./requirement.md).
in the process of doing this I've used some of the tools i've remembered, and had to relearn some along the way. 
The principles are the same (TDD, DI, mocks, clean code etc). 
It's been really good to try out javascript again.
I've tried to demonstrate the requirement, but there will always be something I may have missed.

- Prerequesites
  Node.JS (latest will do)

- to install all the libraries
`npm install`


- to run the tests
`npm test`

 -to have a play with the console demo f the main object under test
 `node main`

Libraries and things uses:
- prettier
- eslint
- jest and jest extended
- inquirer/prompt (for the demo code)

hope you like the repo!
